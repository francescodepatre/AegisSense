# AegisSense
AegisSense is an AI-driven perception and control system designed to enhance situational awareness through automated sensing and responsive tracking. Combining computer vision, embedded control, and real-time actuation, AegisSense detects and localizes people or vehicles using deep learning (e.g., YOLO), then dynamically orients a pan-tilt-mounted sensor to focus on regions of interest.  Developed on a Raspberry Pi platform and integrated with a Kinect sensor and servomotors, the system aims to simulate intelligent behavior in surveillance, defense, or autonomous robotic applications â€” enabling real-time reactivity based on visual cues.
